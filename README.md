This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors console game
**Rock paper scissors**  is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "_rock_" (a closed fist), "_paper_" (a flat hand), and "_scissors_" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).
